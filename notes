User's will need to firstly install docker and docker-toolbox onto their machine.  DockerForMac and DockerForWindows is also highly recomended but I don't belive it's neecessary to get up and running.

Once docker is installed and running open the terminial and using 'docker pull` pull drupal and mariadb.  


docker pull mariadb
docker pull drupal


ok after pulling them we'll want to create a volume to mount so we don't lose database data if the machines stops.  
Use the `docker volume create my-vol` command to have docker create a volume for you.    

docker volume create my-vol
